Open source hyperspectral camera code and design
This is an open-source ultra-low-cost hyperspectral imaging platform based on line scan method. 
Both the design is based on consumer-grade commercial-of-the-shelf components that are both affordable and easily accessible to researchers and users. At the heart of the optical system is a consumer-grade spectroscope along with a basic galvanometer mirror that is widely used in laser scanning devices. The utilized pushbroom scanning method provides a very high spectral resolution of 2.8~nm as tested against commercial spectral sensors. 

Both the Matlab code (GUI / command line scrtip) and the CAD design files and included.
